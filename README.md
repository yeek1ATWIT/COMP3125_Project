# COMP3125 Individual Project
## Introduction

The exploration and analysis of crime helps us understand and address societal problems; this project uses data science to provide further insight as to the possible patterns in crime. The focal point includes analyzing the very city we live in along with analyzing many popular cities spanning the US.

My objective is to use these patterns in crime to ultimately predict crime and crime rates in the future. Hopefully, this objective will help understand the possible crime and threats of the future.

## Selection of Data

The model processing and training are conducted using a Jupyter Notebook.

The dataset is called [Crime in Context](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshallproject/crime-rates)[1]. This dataset contains over 40 years of homicide, rape, robbery and assault crimes across 68 police jurisdictions with populations of 250,000 or greater.

This dataset was modified to exclude any illegal values including blank and NAN values.

## Methods

Tools:
- NumPy, Pandas, difflib, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and inference
- GitHub for hosting/version control
- Jupyter as IDE

Inference methods used with Scikit:
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) 
- Linear Regression

Inference methods used with difflib:
- get_close_matches
